See Table \ref{tbl:sense-hierarchy} for sense hierarchy.

\subsubsection{Explicit vs implicit discourse connectives} \label{sec:implexpl}

\input{figures/sense_hierarchy}

It is not always possible to consider implicit discourse relations simply as explicit relations with the connective removed.

\begin{exe}
\ex I want to go to New York, but I already booked a flight. (I am not going to New York.)\label{example:notny}
\ex I want to go to New York, so I already booked a flight. (I am going to New York.)\label{example:ny}
\end{exe}

Here, we have either a COMPARISON.Contrast, or a CONTINGENCY.Cause relation depending on what form the sense takes. If we were to remove the connective token, our linguistic intuition tells us to default for the meaning of Example \ref{example:ny}, that is, CONTINGENCY.Cause. How can we use this to our advantage when classifying implicit connectives? (Honest question, still don't know.)

\section{Related work}

Up until this task little focus had been given to this topic from a parsing perspective, something which reflected the work in the final contributions: all papers built upon the same discourse parser as presented by \citep{lin_pdtbstyled_2014} with little variance in the form of alternative architectures. Given the complexity of the task this is not surprising, since this allows contributors to work within a focus area. \citep{lin_pdtbstyled_2014} is the first PDTB-styled end-to-end discourse parser with a parsing pipeline that closely reflects the annotation pipeline of PDTB. We will have a closer look at the components of the parser in Section \ref{sec:lin_parser}.
