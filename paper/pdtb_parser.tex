\subsection{The PDTB end-to-end discourse parser}

The first parser developed for the Penn Discourse Treebank was developed by \citep{lin_pdtbstyled_2014}, where they take a sequential approach in the parsing pipeline closely imitating the annotation procedure during the development of the PDTB. The pipeline behaves as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Label all explicit relations
    \item Identify and label all implicit relations
    \item Label attribution spans
\end{enumerate}

And so on...
